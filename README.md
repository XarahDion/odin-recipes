# odin-recipes
I have learned how to create a recipes webpage with html and VScode and publish it on the web with GitHub.
I used a variety of notions taught in the Odin introductory class to web developpement.
I now know how to create: a boiler plate, ordered and unordered lists, links to images and to webpages.
