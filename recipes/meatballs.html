    <p>The best melt-in-your-mouth meatballs.</p>
    <p>Ingredients :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1 large egg, slighly beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan</li>
        <li>1/3 cup dried bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 tsp fresh minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp fresh ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps :</h4>
    <ol><li>Mix all ingredients together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Shape into small meatballs (at this point you can place on a jelly-roll/baking sheet and freeze to use later, or cover with plastic wrap refrigerate up to 24 hours before using).</li>
        <li>Drop the meatballs into simmering pasta sauce, do not stir for at least 20 minutes or you will risk breaking the meatballs.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking in the simmering sauce for another 20 minutes (depending on how fast your sauce is simmering 40 minutes total should fully cook the meatballs).</li>
        <li>After the 40 minutes cooking time continue cooking your sauce with the meatballs in for as long as desired.</li>
      
    </ol>
    <p>**note** you may also bake the meatballs at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes or until cooked through.</p>
